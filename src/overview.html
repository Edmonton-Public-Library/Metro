            <h3>MeCard</h3>
            <p>The Metro Edmonton Federation of Libraries (MEFOL) has joined together to 
                provide more convenient library services by breaking down the geographic 
                barriers of the library card. This partnership allows patrons to register 
                their library card at melibraries.ca and access printed, audio and visual 
                materials at any of the following municipal libraries: Edmonton Public 
                Library; Fort Saskatchewan Public Library; St. Albert Public Library and 
                Strathcona County Library. Register your card now. For more information 
                contact your local library.</p>
            <p>
                The MeCard allows customers from one library to join, participate, and borrow
                resources at another library. Think of it like the TAL (The Library of Alberta)
                but without having to fill out cumbersome paperwork or getting a new library card
                number. You submit your home library card number and pin, which is then registered
                at any other affiliated library.</p>
            <p>
                For this to occur a significant amount of cooperation has to take place
                behind the scenes. The two libraries must agree to the terms of MeCard policies,
                on a political level, then both ILSs must cooperate to produce and consume
                information about customers in an ILS agnostic way.

                Enter project Metro. Metro is the service that runs on the ILS server and performs
                the function of negotiating and translating communications between different ILSs.
                The design is centered around a few simple requests that are initiated by the 
                customer on a website, then translated and sent to the home (host) library, a 
                response is generated, sent back to the website. The website then confirms the 
                transaction is a way that ensures that no identifiable customer information is 
                stored then passes the response on again as another request to the guest library.
                The guest then creates a new user record in their ILS.
