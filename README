Metro Federation of Libraries
=============================

The Metro Federation of Libraries members are Edmonton Public Library (EPL), 
Ft. Saskatchewan Public Library (FSPL), St. Albert Public Library (SAPL), 
and Strathcona County Library (SCL). The Metro Federation members share 
an interest in collaborating to increase access to library collections 
and programs for our customers across the Metro Edmonton region. The 
Me Card project was created to reduce barriers in accessing the library 
collections and diverse programs of the Metro Federation libraries.

What is the Me Card service?
----------------------------

The Me Card is a web-based service that allows customers with a library 
card from an affiliated Metro Federation library to create an account 
with and access the collections and programs at one or more other 
affiliated Metro Federation libraries.  Interested customers complete 
a self-service web form to create an account with libraries other than 
their home library, letting them use their home library card as their 
library card at any registered library.

Metro is the server that runs on the ILS server and performs
the function of negotiating and translating communications between different ILSs.
The design is centered around a few simple requests that are initiated by the 
customer on a website, then translated and sent to the home (host) library, a 
response is generated, sent back to the website. The website then confirms the 
transaction is a way that ensures that no identifiable customer information is 
stored then passes the response on again as another request to the guest library.
The guest then creates a new user record in their ILS.
