MeCard
======
The MeCard allows customers from one library to join, participate, and borrow
resources at another library. Think of it like the TAL (The Library of Alberta)
but without having to fill our cumbersome paperwork or getting a new library card
number. You submit your library card number and pin, and then register at any
other affiliated library.

For this to occur a significant amount of cooperation has to take place
behind the scenes. The two libraries must agree to the terms of MeCard policies,
on a political level, then both ILSs must cooperate to produce and consume
information about customers in an ILS agnostic way.

Enter project Metro. Metro is the service that runs on the ILS server and performs
the function of negotiating and translating communications between different ILSs.
The design is centered around a few simple requests that are initiated by the 
customer on a website, then translated and sent to the home (host) library, a 
response is generated, sent back to the website. The website then confirms the 
transaction is a way that ensures that no identifiable customer information is 
stored then passes the response on again as another request to the guest library.
The guest then creates a new user record in their ILS.
