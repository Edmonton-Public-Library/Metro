== Protocol ==
The protocol for metro is a simple request response message system, where each message is a string of pipe-delimited fields. Once a socket is open to a metro service it will acknowlege with a code <code>XK0|</code> signaling that it is ready for a request, or if there was a socket error on the server you may get a <code>XE0|</code>. The code <code>XX0|</code> terminates the session.
As soon as the client contacts a mecard service it will receive an acknowlege
 "XX0|" = TERMINATE
 "XK0|" = ACKNOWLEDGE
 "XE0|" = ERROR

All fields are separated with a delimiter
 DELIMITER   = "|"
 DEFAULT_FIELD = "X"

=== Query Types ===
Sending receiving requests from Metro requires some knowlege of the communication protocol. The protocol is broken down into two types of activities standard to all network communication: request, or query, and response. Requests are innumerated below:
 "QA0" = GET_STATUS
 "QB0" = GET_CUSTOMER
 "QC0" = CREATE_CUSTOMER
 "QD0" = UPDATE_CUSTOMER
 "QN0" = NULL
NULL is a special command type that has no effect.

=== Response Types ===
 "RA9" = ERROR // Command was received but failed to execute either it was malformed, empty (null), or not supported.
 "RA0" = INIT // all responses start in this state, but once the constructor is finished the state changes to BUSY.
 "RA1" = OK  // occurs if a query was successful but there is nothing to return, as with get status of the ILS.
 "RA2" = BUSY // Initial working state of a query, testing a response during execution would return this value.
 "RA3" = UNAVAILABLE // occurs if the SIP2 server timesout, or the ILS is unavailable.
 "RA4" = SUCCESS // occurs if the query was successful.
 "RA5" = FAIL // occurs if the request failed, ie: the customer's account couldn't be found.
 "RA6" = UNAUTHORIZED // occurs if the client sends the wrong API key, or if the user id and password don't match.
